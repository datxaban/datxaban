### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Dat Doan

I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree at Aalto University in Finland, building on the strong foundation I laid as a Bachelor's student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology. My academic journey reflects my deep interest in cloud technology and system development, which I complement with hands-on experience as a fullstack developer. This multifaceted background fuels my passion for crafting innovative solutions that leverage cloud technology. I thrive in creating seamless and scalable systems, drawing from my expertise in both frontend and backend development. My commitment to delivering top-notch results, whether collaborating in teams or working independently, drives me to continuously expand my skill set and stay ahead in this dynamic industry.
